# Trigger.dev examples

Welcome to @trigger.dev/examples, a collection of projects using Trigger.dev.

## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is a framework for creating long-running Jobs directly in your Next.js app with API integrations, webhooks, scheduling and delays. You can reliably run Jobs that wouldnâ€™t normally work in serverless environments (like Vercel) because of timeouts.

## Purpose of this Repository

The @trigger.dev/examples repository serves as exploring the capabilities of Trigger.dev through practical examples. Each project in this collection demonstrates how to leverage Trigger.dev's features.
